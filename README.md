# IPMI Fan Controller

This is a container with a webGUI to manage a Dell servers fan speeds using IPMI. You must enable IPMI from iDRAC. You can pass credentials through enviroment variables or enter them in the webGUI at runtime. 

I am hoping to expand this tool to include more features and support multiple servers.
